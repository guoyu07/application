    Spiral PHP Framework, Current Status
    =======================
    The Spiral framework provides a Rapid Application Development (RAD) platform to develop software applications using an MVC architecture, using a
    simple but strong syntax similar to other popular frameworks.

    Spiral was originally built in 2009 for internal projects and has been continuous updated over the last few years. In 2015, I decided to open source
    the framework so that developers had a better way to build custom applications quickly.

    At the moment, I'm still transitioning some of the old codebase into the new architecture.

    What is ready
    =================
    Here is a list of features, which were successfully moved to the new core. At the moment, no tests have been created.

    DBAL (+ migrations)
    -------------
    Currently, you can use the DBAL level with 4 different databases (MySQL, PostgresSQL, SQLite, SQLServer). The database schema has building
    and reading abilities, query builders, etc.

    The DBAL builder is built on the principals of a two directional database schema reading, which allows you to not only create database migrations,
    but to analyze existing table schemas (this functionality is used in ORM).

    IoC
    -------------
    The Core includes a build-in container with set of component bindings. Additionally Spiral has "controllable injection"
    where you can request from the factory what specific version of instance you need in your controller method (method injection)
    or any constuctor (constructor injection). This idea was implemented for dbal databases, mongo databases, storage
    containers, cache stores (by class name), and redis clients.

    Example:
    ```php
    public function action(Database $default, Database $postgres, ..., MemcacheStore $memcache, ...)
    {
    dump($default);
    }
    ```

    ODM
    -------------
    Mongo databases and odm documents are moved without any problems.

    Views
    -------------
    View component and all processors moved without any problems. Html Composer (templater) works without any problems. However, your tests
    should be updated.

    Storage
    -------------
    The storage component was moved without many changes. It currently works with Amazon, Rackspace, FTP and local storages
    using prefixes to detect location.

    Localization
    -------------
    Localization has been completed, which includes component traits, views, pluralization, etc.

    Console and Console Commands
    -------------
    Old code was wiped clean and switched to Symfony classes. Command to configure application, install modules, perform migrations and
    update ODM schema (plus UML export) are all ready.

    Modules
    -------------
    Modules are working well. This includes bindings, installers, and resources. Check sample modules spiral-toolkit and spiral-markdown.
    Profiler has not been updated.

    Image
    -------------
    ImageObject works well, but currently there is only one image processor (which we have been using for 4 years) - ImageMagic via console interface.

    ORM
    =================
    Currently in development (will take week or two).

    What is NOT ready
    =================
    Currently I'm in the middle of planning new HttpDispatcher realization. Even though we already had Routes, Requests and Responses
    in a previous generation, I would like to consider implementing PSR7 and middleware(s). Based on this plan of action, the following pieces
    are not ready:

    Paginator
    -------------
    The entire pagination class is ready with its' interfaces and traits. However, it currently can't receive a page number from a
    request as there isn't a request :)

    Session, Cookies and CRSF tokens
    -------------
    This will require some tweaking to fit into HttpDispatcher middleware.

    Profiler module
    -------------
    Profiler was originally handling the dispatcher::response event. There is no such event at the moment and profiler doesn't function well.
